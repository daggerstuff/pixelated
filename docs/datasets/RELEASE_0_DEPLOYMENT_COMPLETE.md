## 🚀 Next Steps - Training Pipeline

### Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 Hours)

1. **Run Production ChatML Export**
   ```bash
   cd /home/vivi/pixelated
   uv run ai/dataset_pipeline/chatml_export_generator.py
   ```

   - Expected duration: 30-60 minutes for full export
   - Streaming mode handles 1.2GB priority dataset efficiently

2. **Execute Quality Gates on Full Dataset**
   ```bash
   # After ChatML export completes
   uv run ai/dataset_pipeline/quality_gates_runner.py --full-dataset
   ```
   - Process all 83,500 conversations
   - Generate comprehensive compliance report
   - Flag any PII, bias, or duplicate issues

3. **Upload Training-Ready Data to S3**
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync ai/training_ready/data/release_0_chatml/ \
